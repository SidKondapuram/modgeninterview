# modgeninterview
Sample code for the interview
I had to use the breakdown from Martin Spielauer (http://www.spielauer.ca/IMA09_RiskPaths_MS.pdf) for writing since the RiskPath guide
provided was outdated since it used Visual Studio and I am on a Mac machine, and also the fact that it used a different syntax compared
to how OpenM++ was written.

I ran into a fair bit of problems with certificates since the OpenM++ version hasn't been properly optimized for the M1 Chip on the Macbook Air (https://github.com/openmpp/openmpp.github.io/wiki/MacOS-Quick-Start-Developer)
But nonetheless I used the guide provided in the Spielauer document to write a riskpath model that uses the RiskPaths.dat and various .mpp files to accomplish
the riskpath modeling using the probabilities.
